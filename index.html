      <h2> Welcome to the Magic of Firebase </h2>
      <p>
        This is meant to be a basic introduction to Firebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goals are to introduce the role and value of the 'backend' when building web applications and begin to get you familiar with Firebase as a backend technology.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3> Enter the Backend </h3>
      <p> Lets take a look at some applications we are familiar with. </p> 
    	<p> <span> <a href="http://www.missionbit.com/operation-peach" target="_blank"> Operation Peach </a>  is a game developed by a team in one of the Mission Bit 2014 spring semester Intro Web Programming classes.  Open up Operation Peach in two different browsers sized to view side by side on your computer. Begin to play both games. Describe what the application is doing. Is this the behavior you'd expect? Now refresh the browsers. </span>
    	</p>
      <p> <span> In a new tab in each browser navigate to <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank"> Amazon </a>. Log into your Amazon account in both browsers. In browser 'alpha' go to your primary 'wish list' or create a new wish list if you don't have one. In browser 'beta' add three items to your wish list. Pay attention to what happens in 'alpha' each time you add an item to your wish list in 'beta'. Now refresh 'alpha' and take note of behavior. </span> </p>
      <p> <span> In a new tab in each browser navigate to <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank"> Twitter </a>. Log into your Twitter account in both browsers. In both browsers go to your profile page (twitter.com/username). In 'alpha' send a tweet. Observe 'beta' for 90 seconds. Any action? In 'beta' scroll down the page. Any action? Now refresh both browsers. </span> </p> 
      <h4> How would you describe what the backend is doing in the Amazon and Twitter applications? </h4> 
      <p> The backend for Amazon and Twitter are recording and storing data and the users interactions with the data. </p>
      <h4> Extra: How would your categorize key differences in the Amazon and Twitter data sets? </h4>  
      <hr> 
      <h3> Demo Apps </h3> 
      <p> <span> Let observe a simple <a href="home.html" target="_blank"> 'auction-like app' </a> with not backend. Open the app in two seperate browsers side by side. Begin bidding in both browsers. Take note of the behavior. Refresh both browsers and not behavior. </span> </p> 
      <h4> Enter Firebase </h4> 
      <p> <span> In a new tab in each browser, lets observe the same <a href="firehome-safe.html" target="_blank"> 'auction-like app' </a> now wired with firebase on the backend. Take note of the behavior. Refresh both browsers and note behavior. </span> </p> 
      <h5> <span> Describe the differences between the two versions of the demo app. Describe the role of the backend. </span> </h5>
      <p> <span> Lets take a look at another kind of app, <a href="chat.html" target="_blank"> a simple chat app</a>, that takes advantage of Firebase 'realtime' (can also be descibed as 'reactive') power. Again open it in two browsers side by side. Begin entering messages in both browsers and observe what is happening in the other browser. </span></p>
      <hr>
      <h3> Time to Build  </h3> 
      <p> <span> Build a simple help request system with the following functionality </span> <p>
      <p> User Page. On this page of the app, the user submits a message about what they need help with.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Include two input fields. One for the user name and one for the help message </li>
        <li> Include a running list, ordered chronologically, of the user names in the queue to be helped. The message does not need to be displayed in the user queue. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Helper (customer service representative) Page. On this page of the app, the helper is able review the requests and intitiate help.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Display a running list, ordered chronologically, of the user names and their help messages. </li>
        <li> With each help message include a 'help' button.  </li>
        <li> When the 'help' clicks the help button. Two things happen. The request is removed from the 'helper' queue and the username is removed from the user view of the queue. Additionally, the user and the helper are taken to a new page 'help chat' page where the helper can asked additional questions from and provide answers to the user. Extra: on this 'help chat' page have the first message displayed be the original 'help message' posted by the user </li>
      </ul>
      <h4> Info and Resources </h4>
      <h5> Feel free to reuse code from the demo apps. The chat app code will be most userful </h5>
